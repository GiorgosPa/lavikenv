# lavikenv

This repository contains my Bash, ZSH, and Vim settings.

## Installation

### Config files

To install the config files:

    git clone https://github.com/jalavik/lavikenv.git
    cd lavikenv
    . install

This will create backups for anything already existing and add symlinks
to the files in the repository, for easy upgrade later.
